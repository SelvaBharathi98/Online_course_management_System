# Online_course_management_System


It's a web-based application for keeping track of things online. I created this product in response to a real-world need for a course called Soft Skill, which assists students in gaining knowledge in a competitive world. This project is solely focused on assisting the instructor in maintaining the course, such as attendance and fees paid (in some cases, students are permitted to pay a portion of the charge on a day-by-day basis).
Description: 

Online soft skill course administration that allows the administrator to track weekly attendance for all soft skill classes, as well as fees and student information. It also keeps track of the weekly report. We may tell the pupils how many days they attended classes based on the weekly report. It's also beneficial to know the course students' information on a yearly basis.
